\section{Introduction}
% Introduce briefly, the significance of the topic investigated in the
% laboratory work.


\section{Objectives}
% Describe in point form the main objectives of the experiment.


\section{Theory}
% Provide minimum theory that is only essential to evaluate the quantities of
% interest in the experiment.


\section{Apparatus}
% Describe the main apparatus with all instrumentation attached to it that was
% used for carrying out the experiment. Indicate the range and accuracy of
% measuring devices.

\section{Procedure}
% Explain briefly how measurements were made, parametric values used and
% precautions taken.


\section{Results}
% Present in tabulated form, all the original measurements and the final
% computed results with their units. DO NOT over-state accuracy of computed
% results beyond what is obtainable from measurements. Graphs must be properly
% labelled for identification of variables.


\section{Discussion}
% Discuss all observable trends or patterns of the readings taken or results
% computed. Give possible reasons for such variations and explain the observed
% behaviour. Discuss possible sources of errors of measurements and
% improvements that may lead to better results.


\section{Conclusion}
% Comment on how satisfactorily the initial objectives of the experiment were
% achieved.
